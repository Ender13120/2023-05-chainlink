Where are the committing and executing DON implemented?
Maybe the answer is obvious, but I cant find really find the corresponding contracts


[05/27/2023 05:44] pramod_hs
@DishWasher Committing and executing DON are implemented offchain.


[05/27/2023 05:47] 0xnirlin
Any previous audit reports?


[05/27/2023 06:11] rensrr
No previous audit reports to share, no


[05/27/2023 06:12] dishwasher84
So their implementation wont be audited?


[05/27/2023 06:13] rensrr
It will be, just not in this audit


[05/27/2023 06:14] dishwasher84
Allright 👍


[05/27/2023 06:26] rensrr
Just to be clear, these DONs are not Solidity contracts. The OCR2 contracts you see in the repo contain all OCR2 logic. The DONs are offchain code, written in Go that communicate through the OCR2 contracts. For examples you can check the chainlink repo https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink. This repo won't contain the CCIP plugin logic but will contain other OCR2 plugins under `core/services/ocr2/plugins/`

Hi there , do we have any Automated Findings for this audit ?

They'll be released once the bot race has been judged, usually ~24h after the contest start time

{Reactions}
💯 

[05/27/2023 08:21] 0xumarkhatab
yeah that's what i thought because bot race was not mentioned there in audit description


[05/27/2023 08:27] t.nero
Is the committing DONs group completely separate from the executing DONs group, or how it'll be chosen for each task? I mean, this is written in the website: "Hundreds of High Quality Nodes", so does it safe to assume that DONs are 100% trusted party, any attack relating to a malicious DONs should be considered invalid?


[05/27/2023 08:58] rensrr
The DON is assumed to have `<= f` faulty or malicious members, with f defined in the OCR2 config. So a single malicious node is not out of scope but a fully malicious DON is.

All, we have updated the welcome post at the top of this channel and the audit page on the website, to clarify that all findings for this audit will remain private to the sponsor team. **For this reason, there will be no automated findings report for this audit. **

Bot race participants will be awarded from the $5k pool that was originally announced, but C4 will also be contributing another $5k that will be split among the HM, QA, and Gas pools.

User fees are transferred from DApp to EVM2EVMOnRamp in Router. Please refer to ccipSend function https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-chainlink/blob/main/contracts/Router.sol#L94


[05/28/2023 20:51] co0nan
Fees got transferred through the feeToken which could be any ERC20 and not necessary LINK token. Am I missing something?


[05/28/2023 20:54] pramod_hs
Yes, that's right, FeeToken can be any ERC20. But should be configured in OnRamp before an ERC20 can be used as FeeToken. Please refer to FeeTokenConfigArgs.

Technically ERC777 supports ERC20 right? In that case it would work but we would simply only use the ERC20 logic. I'm not very familiar with ERC777 but if implemented to be fully ERC20 compatible I don't see why it wouldn't work

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[05/29/2023 07:25] rensrr
function `withdrawNonLinkFees` ensures enough LINK is in the contact to pay all nops in LINK before any of the native fee tokens are withdrawn, effectively making it a swap from link -> otherFeeCoins (wrapped native). The owner is able to call this function and they should therefore make sure enough LINK exists in the contract for the owner to receive the non-link tokens

Hi team

What's the purpose of the allowlist ? Will it be activated?


[05/29/2023 14:11] pedroais
Just saw "allowlist will be removed before public launch"

So I will assume the intention is it will be permanently turned off


[05/29/2023 14:17] m_rassska
```s_wrappedNative``` is it the address behind wrapped version of a native coin. For instsance, for the router on ethereum it's - `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`?

The allowList is currently active as we're in closed beta. When we go public we will remove the allowList code or always have it turned off

[05/29/2023 15:28] rensrr
For Eth on mainnet, it will be WETH, for Avax on Avalanche it will be WAVAX. If no wrapped version is available on a chain we can deploy one. When multiple exist we will examine the correct one to be used, with adoption being an important aspect in the decision

To be clear on this, all I said is they should probably*work*. Not that we officially support or even intend to support erc777. We support ERC20, some other token standards will probably *work* if they are ERC20 compatible. That doesn't mean CCIP supports all those standards and they are all suddenly included in the scope of this audit.

Does the approach of only having a single router contract per chain scale if ccip increases in user numbers?


[05/30/2023 10:31] rensrr
I'm not sure what part of the router wouldn't scale


[05/30/2023 10:35] dishwasher84
Maybe there is some basic misunderstanding on my part, I have not been doing this for too long. 
I mean the fact that there is one router contract and many users want to access this contracts code.
Could this lead to congestion, i.e. having to wait until being able to access the contract?


[05/30/2023 10:37] rensrr
It will go as fast as the blockchain allows it. If CCIP is bottlenecked by the underlying blockchain we'd be extremely successful. More contracts does not equal more throughput

But it would be better if we could get the automated findings like before even though you said they would be with the sponsors. 
**Even the description/title of the findings would be enough just to get an idea.** Otherwise the audit will end up with too many duplicates & thus more time till the results are declared.
& after a month, everyone just starts getting impatient 🥲 
A humble request, if possible 🙌🏻

[05/30/2023 21:38] rensrr
ARM is per chain, as the contracts can only live on a single chain at a time. When a curse event happens related to e.g. sending chain A that is connected to chain B, C and D, all those chains will receive curse votes. ARM interventions should be rare

As opposed to the router, this contract is lane specific, meaning there is an onRamp instance for every lane

Hey @everyone 

**Announcement: ** We will be reverting to what were the stated rules of the audit before it launched, and making the winning bot race report public and valid as we have the approval now from the sponsor to include these findings now as out-of-scope. I know some of you were asking about this and we have communicated otherwise previously, and I'm aware that this will affect the mechanism to an extent. 

However, given that there are still 12 days left we feel that making the report public will be more helpful rather than detrimental to the competition. The eventual findings repo will still be kept private at the request of the sponsor. 

Please accept my sincere apologies as there was some miscommunication on my part leading to this.

I don't have a stake on this since I didn't participate on the bot race. But I think both mediums are invalid according to the contest description. 


- 1
> The owner is a single point of failure and a centralization risk

The contest info says : 
> Trust Assumptions
> Owner for all contracts will be a Committing DON controlled owner contract

There is no single point of failure since the owner will be a DON controlled contract, not an EOA

- 2
> Unsafe use of transfer()/transferFrom() with IERC20    

This is in cases of non standard ERC20 implementations
The contest info says :
> Tokens will be audited prior to whitelisting

Please be coherent with displayed info when judging. The first issue is not valid at all since the owner will be a governance controlled contract. Any potential problems on those contracts is out of scope.

The second issue I think is valid but out of scope since the Chainlink team stated they will audit each token. Therefore, it's implied we should assume they won't approve tokens with non standard behaviour.

I have nothing against these issues being on the report and as I said it doesn't affect me (I didn't participate on the bot race) but it's frustrating to see misleading info on the contest sheet and then see the issues still being accepted.

[05/31/2023 23:02] pedroais
Yes but also someone who did read the documentation could abstain from reporting an invalid issue which is then payed because of the limited time. 

I think we all agree these issues are invalid but there because of the limited time. So the incentive is to create the report with more issues, even if they are invalid since the judge will still award them because of limited time.

I don't want to argue, I love code4rena and your work, it's just that as a warden a lot of time you don't know what to report because you see on the description a certain thing shouldn't be valid and then it's still awarded.


[05/31/2023 23:03] sockdrawermoney

do you mean paid out in bot races? bot races are basically just a ranked best/A/B/C report like gas/QA


[05/31/2023 23:05] pedroais
There are 2 mediums on the report, not just gas/QA. I think the mediums are invalid.


[05/31/2023 23:06] alexxander
there is a bot race pool that's different from main H/M pool


[05/31/2023 23:06] sockdrawermoney
yeah that's the key; it's paid like QA and gas are


[05/31/2023 23:07] sockdrawermoney
so several bots could report the same false positives and in the interest of time, the report could just be shared unedited despite how the judge reviewed those issues

At the risk of information overload, here's a diagram picturing the system over multiple chains. Do note the arrows from offRamp -> PriceRegistry are not drawn for Optimism due to how messy that would become, they are drawn on other chains. The diagram also includes an in progress lane upgrade. We would not deploy unidirectional lanes in production and we do not (yet) support non-evm, these are just to illustrate the interactions between contracts and high-level concepts.

| [M‑02] | Contracts are vulnerable to fee-on-transfer accounting-related issues | 1 | L |
| [M‑03] | Excess funds sent via msg.value not refunded | 1 | L |


[06/01/2023 12:22] rensrr
Just from the description I can see what 2 and 3 relate to. M-02 would be out of scope as we audit tokens prior to listing. The codebase clearly isn't designed to work with fee-on-transfer tokens
M-03 is addressed in a comment in the router `// Note we take the whole msg.value regardless if its larger.`

[06/01/2023 16:11] rensrr
A curseID can be created by any ARM member to indicate they want to curse. They create this value themselves and it should correspond to a single curse reason. Multiple can curseIDs can be active at the same time, if there are multiple reasons to curse. e.g. multiple source chains have deep re-orgs.

What is the purpose of `report.interval.min` and `report.interval.max` in `CommitStore.sol`? Does the `s_minSeqNr` not suppose to be increased by 1 for each call, I mean, why `s_minSeqNr = report.interval.max + 1`?


[06/02/2023 04:49] m_rassska
I haven't looked into CommitStore yet, but it seems that if you have a report of n msgs, after verifying the whole report, `s_minSeqNr = report.interval.max + 1` seems okay, because interval [x; x + n] has been finilized. Maybe, i'm missing smth here...

Abi encoding adds extra zeros to fill out an entire storage slot, which is 32 bytes. You can play around with abi encoding here https://adibas03.github.io/online-ethereum-abi-encoder-decoder/#/encode

[06/04/2023 08:53] rensrr
They serve a different purpose, one adds and the other multiplies. If you have a gas cost of 500k, a multiplication of 110% is very different from 200k x110%, while adding a static 50k would be the same for both txs.


[06/04/2023 09:12] dishwasher84
If I understand it correctly, the Executing DON listens for ```CCIPRequested(message)``` and ```ReportAccepted(report)``` events.
The message contains the messageID, which is the hash used as the leaf of a merkle tree (the merkle root of which is contained in the report).
So the executing DON has the merkle root constructed from a bunch of messages in the commiting DON as well as all the leaf hashes as they were emitted by the OnRamp. But how does it know which messages, i.e. messageIDs to use to reconstruct a received merkle root?
Are the emitted messages always included in reports in the order in which they were received?

The commitReport includes a sequence number range. Yes, the leaves in the report are ordered based on their sequence number.

Hi everyone. Could you explain more precisely what is reportContext ?
,
// reportContext consists of:
    // reportContext[0]: ConfigDigest
    // reportContext[1]: 27 byte padding, 4-byte epoch and 1-byte round
    // reportContext[2]: ExtraHash

But at the same time I see in test the following:

function testTransmit3SignersSuccess_gas() public {
    vm.pauseGasMetering();
    bytes32[3] memory reportContext = [s_configDigest, s_configDigest, s_configDigest];

So it looks like  [1] an [2] are not so important if they are simply replaced with s_configDigest ?

As I understand it's a roundId and an epoch is the time between roundIds. So several reports can be transmitted with the same roundId and the same epoch?


[06/04/2023 11:07] dishwasher84
different round ids within same epoch I would say:

[06/04/2023 13:18] marckn
My interpretation is: CCIP  uses the reportContext configDigest to revert on a config mismatch and to emit the configDigest with the epoch in the transmitted event. not more.

Hey @Rens | Chainlink, sent you a DM!


[06/05/2023 10:15] rensrr (pinned)
Hi all, answering some questions that get repeated in DMs quite often

- for the purposes of this audit, assume `n` = 3f + 1. Let's say f = 5 => n = 16. Since we require (n+f)/2 + 1 signatures, this means (16+5)/2+1 = 11 signatures.

- The rate limiting in ramps if different from the token pool rate limiting in the sense that ramps use USD and pools use the token itself. This is intentional, as the ramps rate limit over many tokens and require a shared denomination. The pools only rate limit a single token.

- If `s_wrappedNative` is set to address(0), this means there is no auto wrapping native, therefore, native payments are disabled. 

- For LINK NOP payments in onRamp, some entity needs to supply the LINK tokens so the non-link tokens can be redeemed. This can be the owner but technically anyone is able to send link to the contract to unlock the non-link fee tokens.

Does the attestation that is used by the MessageReceiver contain the signatures of the Execution DON or is it rather signatures by the TokenPool provider?


[06/06/2023 12:01] kowalski_analysis
@DishWasher I might be completely wrong but I think Circle is responsible for the attestation. (Docs say so https://developers.circle.com/stablecoin/docs/cctp-technical-reference#block-confirmations-for-attestations)   So the signatures should belong to Circle's attestation service.

what the `_bitmapGet` function do in the `ARM.sol` contract ?


[06/07/2023 05:52] 0xnirlin
So from what i undestand is:


on the 128 bit bitmap it first check if the index is in the right range of 128 by assertion.


next we have the line:      return bitmap & (uint128(1) << index) != 0;

uint128(1) gives us a binary where except for the last bit every bit is 0 and last one is 1.


Like this =  000000....00001

next we left shift it by index.

Suppose that index = 3 

So the expression uint128(1) << index, gives us  000000....01 000,  we shifted one to three indices on left.

Than we perform the bitwise And operation.

Lets say the bitmap is 001110...11001

so bitwise and operator will do the following:
0 0 0 0 0 0....0 1  0 0 0
0 0 1  1  1  0...  1  1 0 0  1
......................................
0 0 0 0 0 0....0  1 0 0  0

which gives us the 1, so will return true, if it was 0 would have return false.

The bitmaps in ARM and offRamp are for efficient storage, greatly reducing the number of slots we write to by packing multiple values into a single slot

Hello, am I understanding this right? onRamp contract is lane-specific, so for example,  if I want to send a message from ETH to Polygon, there will be an onRamp contract deployed on Eth mainnet responsible for a Eth-Polygon connection and other onRamp contracts that also deployed on Eth mainnet but for other destination chains?

As the protocol flow passes via offchain oracles how can an issue be considered as High? It can be always argued that those offchain oracles contain prevention mechanism against the attack


[06/08/2023 08:04] rensrr
If you find a bypass for execution that allows you to e.g. make an arbitrary call via our Router contract, feels like a high. Or draining a token pool, or somehow getting the burnMint pool to mint funds that are not locked/burned on another chain. There's many many things that can still be a high, even with offchain oracles involved. (disclaimer, C4 judges, we just asnwer questions so I cannot state for a fact is something is a high but check the readme  `Areas of concern` section)

I don't understand why `networkFeeAmountUSD` and `destGasOverhead` depend on the feeToken used. Like, I would expect they only depend on the destination chain. Instead they are on the `FeeTokenConfig` mapping, so one for each token. Why?


[06/08/2023 19:17] franfran5067
Probably to incentivize the use of certain tokens, such as LINK, as a first guess


[06/08/2023 21:25] rensrr
It was actually cheaper gas wise as we had room left in the slot. But it also gives flexibility so it's a win win

Can I ask how the upgrade process for on-ramp and off-ramp works?


[06/09/2023 07:51] rensrr
We always upgrade the entire lane, so onRamp, commitStore and offRamp. We deploy the new lane and allow the new lane on the chain contracts (priceRegistry, token pools and destination router). When ready to upgrade we point the source router to the new onRamp and from then on all txs will go through the new lane. The old onRamp is immediately no longer used, but the commitStore and offRamp can still process the txs that are in flight for the old lane.

how the `multiplier` is expected to be scaled? 
Particularly, don't understand this one:  `will be tuned according to actual execution costs`. Is there a way to know the actual exec cost by a certain  `message.feeToken`?


[06/10/2023 13:03] rensrr
We will adjust the multiplier according to the data we collect over time. If it turns out that users are underpaying compared to the actual cost of executing the transactions, it might go up a bit. If we see fees are outpacing the gas expenses we can lower the multiplier. We're aiming for the customer gas cost to exactly cover the execution cost.

[06/10/2023 13:04] rensrr
We can only know the actual cost after the ex is executed on the destination chain, so the multiplier will be lagging behind a bit

Getting certified was worth seeing my name in the leaderboard 🙏🏻

Hi! I started the KYC process before the contest ended (i.e. before June 12th), but I never actually submitted the last document I was requested. Can I still finish the process now and get the award?
I totally understand if it's not possible, but wanted to ask just in case 😅


[07/28/2023 05:23] liveactionllamac4
Yes, you can proceed.


[07/28/2023 05:24] .eperez

Damn! Didn't appear here again, what's wrong with my submissions on Code4rena?


[07/28/2023 09:49] MHKK33#5972
How can I check why my submission rejected to improve my submissions next time.


[07/28/2023 10:04] nobody2018
you can apply for backstage to check all issues.


[07/28/2023 10:12] raihan3727

is it possible to survive solely based on code arena ?


[08/17/2023 16:56] 0xstalin
Let's say you are capable of getting average results, like 2-3k per month, it depends where you live, probably in Europe, USA, and Canada it might be quite difficult to make a living with that budget, but in most LATAM countries, India, middle east countries I believe you can afford a nice lifestyle


[08/17/2023 17:02] sockdrawermoney
and if you can get high enough ranking to get the opportunity to compete in invitationals, should be able to make a comfortable living anywhere

2-3k per month is not average at all. That would put you in the top 50 on code4rena.


[08/17/2023 18:17] mike_bello90
how do you get that ranking?


[08/17/2023 18:20] 0xnevi
Anything is possible, if you’re skilled enough and work hard enough.

Most people don’t actually compete full time and many leverage c4 in between other gigs, so reading those numbers that way is probably not as helpful as could be presumed

Basically highest ranks on leaderboard get opportunities based on their availability, but availability fluctuates of course
